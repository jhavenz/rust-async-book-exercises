# 🚀 Getting Started - Quick Setup Guide

## ⚡ Ultra-Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Start the learning journey
./async-exercises next

# 2. Begin with the first exercise  
./async-exercises run 1.1

# 3. Open the exercise file in your editor
# File will be shown in the terminal output, e.g.:
# exercises/chapter01/ex01_basic_async.rs

# 4. Implement the TODO sections

# 5. Check your solution
./async-exercises check 1.1

# 6. Continue to next exercise when complete
./async-exercises next
```

## 🎯 Learning Flow

1. **List** - See all available exercises
2. **Run** - Start an exercise and see the problem
3. **Edit** - Implement the TODO sections in your favorite editor
4. **Check** - Get instant feedback and automated testing
5. **Progress** - Track your advancement through the material

## 📝 Commands You'll Use

| Action | Command | What it does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| 📚 **Start** | `./async-exercises list` | See all exercises |
| 🎯 **Next** | `./async-exercises next` | Get next exercise to work on |
| 🚀 **Run** | `./async-exercises run 1.1` | Start working on exercise 1.1 |
| 🔍 **Check** | `./async-exercises check 1.1` | Validate your solution |
| 📊 **Track** | `./async-exercises progress` | See completion status |

## 🛠️ What You Need

- **Rust** (1.70+) - Already installed? ✓
- **Your favorite editor** - VS Code, vim, emacs, etc.
- **Terminal** - Where you'll run the exercises
- **Curiosity** - Ready to learn async Rust!

## 📂 Where to Edit

Exercise files are located in:
```
exercises/
├── chapter01/
│   ├── ex01_basic_async.rs      ← Edit this for exercise 1.1
│   └── ex02_concurrent_download.rs ← Edit this for exercise 1.2
└── chapter02/
    ├── ex01_future_trait.rs     ← Edit this for exercise 2.1
    └── ex02_custom_executor.rs  ← Edit this for exercise 2.2
```

## 🎯 Exercise Pattern

Each exercise follows this pattern:

1. **Run the exercise** - See starter code and current behavior
2. **Find TODO sections** - Look for `todo!("message")` markers
3. **Read the comments** - They contain implementation hints
4. **Implement the code** - Replace `todo!()` with working code
5. **Check your solution** - Run tests and get feedback
6. **Move to next** - Automatic progression when complete

## ✅ Success Indicators

- ✅ **Code compiles** - No compilation errors
- ✅ **Tests pass** - All automated tests succeed  
- ✅ **No TODOs** - All `todo!()` markers implemented
- ✅ **Performance** - Timing tests verify async benefits

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

```bash
# Check what you need to implement
grep -n "todo!" exercises/chapter01/ex01_basic_async.rs

# See detailed error messages
cargo check --package chapter01 --bin ex01_basic_async

# Reset and start over
./async-exercises reset 1.1

# Get help
./async-exercises help
```

## 🏁 Ready to Begin?

```bash
./async-exercises next
```

Happy coding! 🎉
