//! 
//! Time to get our feet wet with async/await syntax! This is where the fun begins.
//! 
//! ## Here's what we'll figure out
//! 
//! - How to convert regular functions to async ones
//! - The difference between doing things one-at-a-time vs all-at-once
//! - Why async code can be so much faster
//! 
//! ## Quick context
//! 
//! From Chapter 1 of the Rust Async Book:
//! 
//! > Async code allows us to write programs that can do multiple things at once.
//! > Traditional synchronous code executes one operation at a time, blocking until
//! > each completes. Async code can start multiple operations and switch between
//! > them as they wait for external resources.
//! 
//! The key insight is that many programs spend time waiting - for network requests,
//! disk I/O, or timers. Async programming lets us use that waiting time productively.
//! Pretty neat, right?
//! 
//! ## Let's dive in
//! 
//! Fill in the gaps below to convert synchronous functions to async
//! and implement concurrent execution. Don't worry if it feels weird at first -
//! async takes a bit to click.

//! 
//! Now we're getting to the good stuff - seeing async really shine
//! with simulated network downloads.
//! 
//! ## What we're exploring
//! 
//! - How async makes I/O-bound operations way faster
//! - Getting comfortable with futures and concurrent execution
//! - A peek at how async runtimes work their magic
//! 
//! ## Here's the deal
//! 
//! From Chapter 1.2 of the Rust Async Book:
//! 
//! > In a typical threaded application, if you wanted to download two different
//! > webpages at the same time, you would spread the work across two threads.
//! > This is resource-intensive - threads have significant memory overhead.
//! > 
//! > With async, we can perform concurrent operations on a single thread,
//! > using far fewer resources while achieving similar performance.
//! 
//! ## Your turn
//! 
//! Build some download functions and see for yourself how much faster
//! concurrent downloads are compared to waiting for each one to finish.
